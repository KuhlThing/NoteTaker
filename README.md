As someone who wants to retain information, I want an app that allows me to take and save notes so that I can refer to them later and recall the information.

This is an app using Express that allows the user to take notes, with titles for quick reference, and save them on a local server, and delete them. 


To use:

>Open the folder in a terminal in VSCode.

>Type "npm install" in the command line. This should install express, fs, and path.

>Type "node server.js"

>App should now be running on PORT 8080.

>Navigate to localhost:8080 in a browser window.

>Type notes in the body and titles in the head, click the save icon in the corner to save. 

>Saved notes will appear in the left column. They can be deleted by clicking the trash can icon.
